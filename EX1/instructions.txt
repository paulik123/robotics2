2. Open a new terminat and enter the following commands
	cd robotics_project/EX1/start //assuming that robotics_project is located in the home folder
	export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$PWD //makes gazebo search for the required plugins in the current directory
	gazebo jack2_world.sdf --verbose //opens gazebo with a custom world

3. After gazebo has loaded make the gazebo gui window fit on half of the screen(or windowed)

4. Open another terminal, make this terminal fit on the other half of the screen and enter the following commands
	cd robotics_project/EX1/start
	./vel
	control the robot using the WASD keys. //the terminal must be in focus //be gentle
	if things the out of control(it happens) just reset the world (CTRL+R in the gazebo window) and start again.

5. If you move the robot under the box all the way in the prismatic joints of the robot should rise.

cmake ../
make
mv libprismatic_plugin.so ~/robotics_project/EX1/start //moving the plugin in the start folder
